These are the instructions for installing KDSingleApplication using the CMake buildsystem.
CMake version 3.12 or higher is required.

Qt Version support:
 * Qt5 and Qt6 is supported

Also note that the code requires a C++14 compliant compiler,

Please see the comments at the top of CMakeLists.txt for
the available configuration options you can pass to cmake.

The installation directory defaults to C:/Program Files (x86)/KDSingleApplication on Windows
(you'll need admin privileges) and /usr/local on non-Windows.  You can change this
location by passing the option -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/install/path to cmake.

1) From the top directory of your KDSingleApplication installation create a build directory:

     mkdir build

   and change directory into that build directory:

     cd build

2) Now run 'cmake' depending on the kind of build one of the following:
     cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
     cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
     cmake -DKDSingleApplication_STATIC=True -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
     cmake -DKDSingleApplication_STATIC=True -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..

   To define the install-location use for example:
     cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=C:/KDAB/kdsingleapplication ..
     cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/kdsingleapplication ..

3) Unix

   set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to your KDSingleApplication installation lib directory.

   If you do not have LD_LIBRARY_PATH set already, then in your terminal run:
    % LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/kdsingleapplication/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    % export LD_LIBRARY_PATH

   The above must be added into your .bashrc or similar to remain. It may also of course
   be run from a shell just before building software using KDSingleApplication, but in this case
   your settings will only be available for this shell.

4) MacOS

   Proceed as described above, but using DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH instead of LD_LIBRARY_PATH

5) Windows

   For running executables, add the path to the KDSingleApplication dll (kdsingleapplication\bin) into your PATH.
   eg. set PATH=C:\KDAB\kdsingleapplication\bin;%PATH%

   For development, add the path to the KDSingleApplication lib (kdsingleapplication\lib) into your LIB environment.
   eg. set LIB=C:\KDAB\kdsingleapplication\lib;%LIB%

6) Build everything by typing:

   From your top-level KDSingleApplication directory run:

   % make    # Unix, Mac
   % nmake   # Windows

7) (optionally:) Install KDSingleApplication:

   From your top-level KDSingleApplication directory run:

   % make install   # Unix, Mac
   % nmake install  # Windows

   This will copy the necessary files into the sub-directories of your installation path:
   For Unix/Linux, Mac: /usr/local
   For Windows this is: C:\Program Files (x86)\KDSingleApplication

8) Have a look at the examples applications. They will get you started with KDSingleApplication.

== Testing ==
To build the testing harness, pass -DKDSingleApplication_TESTS=true to CMake, like so:
  % cmake -DKDSingleApplication_TESTS=true

Then run 'make test' to run the unit tests.

== Using ==
From your CMake project, add

    find_package(KDSingleApplication CONFIG REQUIRED)

or for Qt6

    find_package(KDSingleApplication-qt6 CONFIG REQUIRED)

and link to the imported target KDAB::kdsingleapplication.
That's all you need to do (the imported target also brings in the include directories)

You may also need to point the CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH environment variable depending
on where you installed KDSingleApplication.
